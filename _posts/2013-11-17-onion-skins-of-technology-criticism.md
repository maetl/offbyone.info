Metaphorical thinking doesn’t control our ideas but it does take us in certain directions.  

Software culture is probably best understood as rhizomatic—a nomadic system of growth, fissures, decay and transformation—but here, I want to use hierarchy as a rhetorical device in order to link micro to macro...


## Syntax and Ego

Disputes about minor, marginal issues flare up with astonishing frequency in technology focused organisations. Often, these disputes take on the emotional tone of apostasy and religious fervour, epitomised by the [eternal holy war of tabs vs spaces](http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html).

In programming culture, this tendency is disambiguated by the [parable of the bike shed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law_of_triviality) and [Wadler’s law](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadler's_Law):

> The emotional intensity of debate on a language feature increases as one moves down the following scale:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semantics,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexical syntax,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments

Received wisdom is that minor issues attract more attention than major ones because they are more tangible. It’s easier for people to understand and form opinions about minor issues, particularly when the issue involves a black and white aesthetic choice. The most vocal people in these debates are driven by an egotistical desire to stamp their personal fingerprint into the artefacts being worked on by a larger group.

Research into small group dynamics suggests that decision-making discussions are [dominated by statements giving opinion](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=RsMNiobZojIC&lpg=PA317&pg=PA319#v=onepage&q&f=true). While this by itself isn’t necessarily harmful, there are various manifestations 

From the [Jargon File](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html):

> The characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as objective technical evaluations. This happens precisely because in a true holy war, the actual substantive differences between the sides are relatively minor.

I could go to town on the propagandistic elements of this piece. 

When is discussion productive and when is it procrastination. Micro, and personal.

Solutions in search of problems

What is professionalism?

“engineers try to solve problems”

## Code Blindness

Next level down is to do with technical debt.
