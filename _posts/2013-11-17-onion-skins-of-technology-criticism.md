Metaphorical thinking doesn’t control our ideas but it does take us in certain directions.  

Software culture is probably best understood as rhizomatic—a nomadic system of growth, fissures, decay and transformation—but here, I want to use hierarchy as a rhetorical device in order to link micro to macro...

## Bike-shedding and Ego

Disputes about minor, marginal issues flare up with astonishing frequency in technology focused organisations. Often, these disputes take on the emotional tone of apostasy and religious fervour, epitomised by the [eternal holy war of tabs vs spaces](http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html).

In programming culture, this tendency is disambiguated by the [parable of the bike shed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law_of_triviality) and [Wadler’s law](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadler's_Law). In academia, it’s [Sayre’s law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre%27s_Law).

Research into small group dynamics suggests that decision-making discussions are [dominated by statements giving opinion](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=RsMNiobZojIC&lpg=PA317&pg=PA319#v=onepage&q&f=true). This by itself isn’t necessarily harmful, but there are familiar patterns to many technology discussions that are almost always judged as negative:

- **Procrastination**: Bikeshedding is a manifestation of avoidance. It’s easier to pontificate and [argue about abstract things](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/procrastination-and-the-bikeshed-effect.html) than to put in the effort to build something.

- **Inexperience**: Dragging people into abstract disputes is a [rookie mistake](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/posts/44-rookies-in-the-bike-shed) leading to results that are less valuable than the energy spent on discussing them. Bikeshedding is an “inherently selfish act” that saps productivity and wastes other people’s time.

These perspectives are passed off as objective counterpoints to an inevitable tendency—“like a natural law,” as Mr Heinemeier Hansson puts it. While valid to a certain extent, these judgements share a common ground in circumscribing behaviour that conflicts with the prevailing technology and business culture of ‘hustle’ and ‘get shit done’. This avoids considering what motivates people to launch into technical disputes and flame wars in the first place.

Received wisdom is that minor issues attract more attention than major ones because they are more concrete and tangible. It’s easier for people to understand and form opinions about things they feel they can control, particularly when the issue involves a black and white aesthetic choice. The most vocal people in these debates are said to be driven by an egotistical desire to stamp their personal fingerprint into the artefacts being worked on by a larger group. Issues of recognition and acceptance 

Is there more to this than selfishness and narcissism? To come to a balanced understanding of this behaviour, we need to look at the hidden power relationships that underlie the negativity expressed towards it.

Vociferous participation in bikeshedding debates may be motivated by a sense of powerlessness and a lack of autonomy. Speaking out about trivial matters might simply be a way for more marginalised people on a team to have their voices heard. This is not narcissism, but an attempt to meet basic human needs for creative expression and approval by the group.

Bikeshedding can also be used as an accusation to slander opinions and shut down discussion on topics which aren’t trivial. This is a form of [microaggression](https://medium.com/about-work/65d4740f7a2f) that dominant individuals sometimes use to assert control over a situation (we’ll explore this more in the next section, when we come to look at the difficulty of defining what an ‘objective technical debate’ really is).

In a business context, bikeshedding behaviour is clearly disruptive and wasteful. In software, trivial discussions aimed at resolving small stylistic issues deliver nothing of value for a company and its customers, so it’s obvious why stakeholders in companies dislike it so much.

It’s interesting then, to see how unproductive behaviour is so often framed as a personal, almost moral failure, when it’s equally possible to see it as a symptom of organisational dysfunction; a failure of management and leadership responsibility.

Focusing exclusively on individual failure and egotism functions to preserve and reinforce the status of dominant groups in the technology industry, and avoids criticism of toxic management and power structures, where people fight over trivial matters as a consequence of frustration and disempowerment.

## Demonstrating Technical Prowess

From the [Jargon File](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html):

> The characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as objective technical evaluations. This happens precisely because in a true holy war, the actual substantive differences between the sides are relatively minor.

What’s notable about this statement is that it tries to position holy wars as an aberration, in opposition to ‘normal technical disputes’. But if such bickering emerges from the [narcissism of small differences](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/05/narcissism-of-small-code-differences.html), it’s reasonable to question whether there is really any difference at all. If a disputed issue can’t be resolved with empirical evidence that proves or disproves a hypothesis, then discussion of the issue will always involve personal value choices.

Many technology problems relate to language and expression where it’s often extremely difficult to disentangle aspects of subjectivity from debates. The central importance of communication conflicts with the engineering value system, which prioritises technical expertise above all else.

Unpacking this leads us into uncomfortable territory for many people, as it exposes the way that a specific form of masculinity is constructed through overt displays of technical prowess. Aggressive displays of self-confidence and ability are viewed by many as a requirement for success in engineering professions. This behaviour is usually justified as a ‘correctness filter’, where the best ideas surface from rigorous arguments which push participants towards finding optimal solutions to problems. Such arguments also perform a symbolic cultural function, reinforcing [the mythos of a male dominated competitive status quo](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.3.7282&rep=rep1&type=pdf) where less obsessed people are taken less seriously.

If such biological differences do exist, in statistical and experiential terms their influence is minuscule and far outweighed by dominant cultural influences. To deny this is to deny a large body of scholarly evidence from research into the under-representation of women in science and technology fields. Yet people still deny this. Despite their pretensions towards a scientific outlook, it’s clear that these men prefer to retreat into comfortable sexist stereotypes, rather than face the reality of facts that conflict with their world view. Change is difficult, but a person who refuses to believe information that conflicts with their world view is a dangerous irrational person.
